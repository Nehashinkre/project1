<p><h5><b>What is disaster management?</b></h5></p>
<pre>
We act before, during and after disasters strike, 
often providing assistance in some of the world’s most hostile environments.

Our disaster management activities seek to:

Save lives and reduce human suffering
Protect and restore livelihoods
Reduce the risks faced by communities affected by disaster and conflict.
</pre>
<p>

<h5><b>Our areas of focus in disaster management include:
</b></h5>
<h6><b>EARLY WARNING
</b></h6>Our teams monitor signals and indicators of both natural and man-made threats. This information warns of emerging events, such as typhoons, flooding, the precursors of famine and stirrings of conflict, so we can anticipate and reduce the impact of a humanitarian emergency.

<h6><b>DISASTER RISK REDUCTION</b></h6>
Through proper training and planning, we can help minimise the loss to children and families when a disaster strikes.

We work with families and individuals as well as local, national and international partners across the world to ensure communities are aware of the risks they face and how to properly prepare and respond in the event of an emergency.

Our programmes are designed to eliminate or mitigate hazards within their control, increase community resilience and provide training in disaster risk reduction. Activities aim to:

<h6><b>Reduce vulnerabilities</b></h6> – including physical, social, economic and environmental factors that increase susceptibility.
Lessen the impacts of natural and man-made conditions that have the potential to adversely impact the lives and livelihoods of communities.
Develop and enhance the capacity of individuals, communities and institutions to reduce risk and build up resilience. The better the capacity the more resilient to risk. 
<h6><b>PREPAREDNESS</b></h6>
In addition to helping communities and families prepare for disasters, our own preparedness means we are ready to help communities when a disaster strikes.

Stores of relief items are maintained in most countries where we work and in strategically-located disaster response warehouses.
